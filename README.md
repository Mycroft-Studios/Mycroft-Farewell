<h1 align='center'>[Mycroft] Final Farewell</a></h1>

For those of you whom are reading this, thank you.

My time within the FiveM community has been amazing, going from a simple developer making a little server to the Owner and Director of ESX.

But, as the time passes, so does my enjoyment and passion. And unfortunately, I just no longer have the motivation or passion to continue making things for FiveM.

So, to say my goodbyes, I am leaving behind a final pack. This pack contains everything that i have worked on between 2020-2022 that is not yet public. The States of these resources vairy from barely started to completely finished. But, i would rather have them out in the public, for people to see and maybe learn from.

Finally, i want to say thank you to FuraXx and ArkSeyonet/LazarusRising for giving me such amazing opportunities and i wish the Best of luck to Benzo & Jean-Baptiste on their adventure continuing the amazing Work at ESX. I also wish the best of luck to ChatDisabled on his adventures making Qbox, which looks very promising and will extend my hopes and wishes to Kakarot in hopes that QB-Core can make a promising comeback from their publicly known downwards spiral they have been in recently.

Thanks for Reading,
Mycroft.
