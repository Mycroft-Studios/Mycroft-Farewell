# ChairBedTarget
ChairBed System using prop targets

This is a system that lets users target props (chairs and beds) to sit or lay on them using an animation.

Add your prop hash (you can get this by using a ID gun or searching on https://forge.plebmasters.de/) and the offsets to the locations area in the config.
You will also need to add the prop hash to either config.seats or config.beds depending on which is is.
